#going over basics:
'''13. Write a short program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using a for loop.
Then write an equivalent program that prints the numbers 1 to 10 using
a while loop'''

#also testing git commit shit

#for loop:
for x in range(0,11,1):
    print ('for loop: {0}').format(x)

#while loop:
count = 0
while count < 11:
    print('while loop: {0}').format(count)
    count = count+1
