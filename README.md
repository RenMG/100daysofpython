## 100 days of code: Focusing on Python
The goal is to do 100 days of Python code to level up from novice +.

Starting by using Automate the Boring Stuff as a starting guide and then integrating projects.

## Things I'd like to learn:
1. Get better with loops
2. Work with more dicts/lists do more advanced loop
3. Better understanding on classes, init and magic methods
4. Learn web UI's and reg UI 
5. Learn data analytic tools

## Exemptions on days:
The only time a day is allowed to be missed is if Rita and I go out of town and I don't bring a computer.  If a day is missed due to this, the days must be made up as soon as possible.

## Keeping Track!
At the top of every file add a title and a day count:
> ##### ABS- Page ## <Project title>
> ##### Day x of 100

Here it notes ABS (Automate the Boring Stuff)- Page Number for reference and Project or test name.
